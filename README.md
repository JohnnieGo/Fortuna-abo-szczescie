I believe this is the first app that brings a 16th-century book into the form of a mobile app. <a target="_blank" href='https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/en/view/bsb00117329?page=1,2'><i>Fortuna abo szczęście</i></a> (eng. <i>Fortune or good luck</i>) is a polish fortune-telling book played by 15th-century townsfolk, and I decided to remake it, along with its interesting mechanics, into a mobile app.

This is my first application, written using JavaScript, HTML and CSS and placed in an Android application using WebView. The app was created while I was learning the basics, so it has a lot of anti-patterns, generally low-quality code and major UX issues. Nevertheless, playing with it is entertaining, and it was great fun developing it. I hope someday I will recreate it with proper technology, e.g. React Native.
